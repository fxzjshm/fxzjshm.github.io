## Problem

When running llama.cpp on RHEL9-like OS, it is noticed that a large portion of time is single-threaded, which is unexpected.

Attaching with GDB shows that it is running `sgemm` provided by OpenBLAS; but OpenBLAS should run with multiple threads.

## Analyze

Search engine gives this post: [Red Hat Bugzilla â€“ Bug 1589823 - The OpenBLAS package that comes with RHEL does not have multithreading capabilities](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1589823)

> Don't use the sequential library if you want the parallel one. Use -lopenblaso for OpenMP and -lopenblasp for pthreads.

This behavior is different from Debian-like OSs.
e.g. in Ubuntu 24.04, the OpenBLAS variant used is mananged by `update-alternatives`, and only `libopenblas.so` is provided.

Moreover, CMake checks `libopenblas.so` only: [FindBLAS.cmake @ 321b71c, line 751-805](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/blob/321b71cfdefa53058e2232772bb3580c2be8c79c/Modules/FindBLAS.cmake#L751-805)

## Solution

Not sure whether package policy or FindBLAS should change. An issue is reported: [cmake/cmake#26659](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/26659).

Workaround is simple:

```bash
sudo mv libopenblas.so libopenblas.so.bak
sudo mv libopenblas.so.0 libopenblas.so.0.bak
sudo ln -s libopenblasp.so libopenblas.so
sudo ln -s libopenblasp.so.0 libopenblas.so.0
```
